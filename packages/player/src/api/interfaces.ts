/**

 * last requested media product finishes playing or after call to reset().
 *
 * PLAYING: TIDAL Player is currently playing the active media product.
 *
 * NOT_PLAYING: TIDAL Player has an active media product, but it is
 * currently not trying to play it. This can be due to the user having
 * pressed pause, some error occurred etc.
 *
 * STALLED: Playback is currently stalled due to some unexpected/unwanted
 * reason but TIDAL Player is still trying to play. E.g. buffering,
 * device resource issues etc. If TIDAL Player manages to resume playback
 * by itself, state will change to PLAYING. If TIDAL Player fails to
 * resume playback, state will change to NOT_PLAYING and a descriptive
 * UserMessage will be sent.
